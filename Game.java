/**
 *  This class is the main class of the "Dharkh Soles" application.
 *  "Dharkh Soles" is a very simple, text based adventure game.  Users
 *  can walk around some scenery, pick and drop items, check their inventory
 *  use a map to see their location, attack AND be attacked by NPCs, give NPCs items,
 *  break OR open doors, talk to NPCs, inspect certain items, teleport to a specific location
 *  if the player has the portal gun OR teleport randomly if they are in the lab.
 *  The player wins if they find the cure AND give the cure to their mother.
 *  The player is vulnerable to dying in the game, as they can be attacked by NPCs.
 * 
 *  This main class creates and initialises all the others: it
 *  creates the parser and starts the game.  It also evaluates and
 *  executes the commands that the parser returns.
